{"name":"Kitchen Data","tagline":"Data sets for cooking apps","body":"### Welcome to Kitchen Data.\r\nIf you've ever tried writing a cooking app, whether it's for mobile or for web, then you've inevitably found yourself trying to gather information across the web about basics like measurement conversions, substitutions, generic cooking times, etc.\r\n\r\nThis repo is meant to provide a hub for some of this common data, but in a semantic-friendly, reusable format.  Currently, we plan to support three formats -- JSON, PLIST and XML -- emphasizing web and mobile-first.\r\n\r\nWe're just getting started with this, so please send me a message (@wubbahed) if you have any questions or would like to contribute. All data sets will be MIT Licensed and freely available to use.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
